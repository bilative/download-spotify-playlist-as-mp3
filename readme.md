## Download whole spotify playlist as mp3

Hey,
Nowadays I started to go gym and I realised I dont like carry my phone with me. And I'm cable-earpods person. So I though that using my old mp3-player could be a good idea.
Idea is good but I wanted to download and save whole songs on my Spotify playlists to this mp3-player. How? hundres of songs?

Yup I automated:
- searching whole spoti songs,
- find them on youtube,
- save them as mp3.

Actually this project is so little, but if someone need this type of thing, this could give you some idea.

---------------
I used Spotify API for this. connection.yaml file is empty in this repostory but you can fill it with your api infos.
